# Upskilling 

## Why?

The cost of software is aprox the cost of change. (Kent Beck https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/monolith-services-theory-practice-617e4546a879). 

We need to minimize the cost of software, so what should we do? 

"Software maintainability is the most important metric. Developers need to maintain the code
Software maintenance accounts for more than 90% of a software productâ€™s lifecycle costs. Developers spend 70% of their time on understanding existing code." https://codescene.com/product/code-health#:~:text=Developers%20need%20to%20maintain%20the,time%20on%20understanding%20existing%20code.

## What? or what each developer needs to know

## Stategy

Simplicity (the opposite of complexity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4 Ruch Hickey). 

We will make our code so that when a change is needed, we get **instant (almost) feedback about the cost of that change**. How? By having everything mostly unit tested. For that we'll use simplification techniques, such as separation of concerns and designs that are simpler, where components are smaller and do less things (simplicity), thus easier to test, and with a high coverage (80-90%), so when you want to make a change, you make it, run the tests (they should run really fast - unit tests focus) and tell you what you broke. And that will give you an idea of what the cost of doing things that way will be.

### Base knowledge

#### 1. Domain Driven Design

A developer today needs o undestand what the domain of an application is, and how to express that correctly - using types or specs. And even more imprtantly he needs to understand that domain means types and pure functions, and everything with side effects is not domain. Yes, that includes the database.

#### 2. Architecture

Kent Beck: Coupling is when you have A and B, and whenever you change A you have to change B as well. 

So how can we design/architect systems, where we can most of the times change A without changing B.

#### 3. Test Driven Development

I am implementing a new feature. I have an idea. I write it down in the code. I run the test suite and break a few tests. Instant feedback. This now presents to me 2 possibilities: should I continue and change and repair the tests and add the ones missing or revert. This instant feedback can tell you *what the cost of a change is*. But how can we build such a system?
